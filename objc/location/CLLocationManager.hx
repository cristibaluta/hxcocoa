 *		trying to achieve an unlimited distance or timeout.
 *
 *		The CLLocationManagerDelegate will continue to receive normal updates as
 *		long as the application remains in the foreground. While the process is
 *		in the background, the device may be able to enter a low-power state for
 *		portions of the specified distance and time interval. While in this
 *		state, locations will be coalesced for later delivery.
 *
 *		Location updates will be deferred as much as is reasonable to save
 *		power. If another process is using location, the device may not enter a
 *		low-power state and instead updates will continue normally. Deferred
 *		updates may be interspersed with normal updates if the device exits and
 *		re-enters a low-power state.
