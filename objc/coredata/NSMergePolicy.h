 * There are two situations in which a conflict may occur:
 * 
 * 1. Between the NSManagedObjectContext and its in-memory cached state at the NSPersistentStoreCoordinator layer.
 *    In this case, the merge conflict has a source object and a cached snapshot but no persisted snapshot (persnap is nil).
 *
 * 2. Between the cached state at the NSPersistentStoreCoordinator and theexternal store (file, database, etc.).
 *    In this case, the merge conflict has a cached snapshot and a persisted snapshot.  The source object is also provided as a convenience,
 *    but it is not directly involved in the conflict.
 * 
 *  Snapshot dictionaries include values for all attributes and to-one relationships, but not to-many relationships.  
 *   Relationship values are NSManagedObjectID references. to-many relationships must be pulled from the persistent store as needed. 
 *
 *  A newVersion number of 0 means the object was deleted and the corresponding snapshot is nil.
