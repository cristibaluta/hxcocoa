 *  kCFStreamPropertySSLContext 
 *
 * The SSLContextRef used for both read and write operations on a
 * CFSocketStream.
 *
 * CFReadStreamCopyProperty or CFWriteStreamCopyProperty return an
 * appropriately reference counted SSLContextRef.  If the stream has
 * not yet been opened, this SSLContext may be configured directly
 * using the appropriate SecureTransport APIs.
 *
 * CFReadStreamSetProperty or CFWriteStreamSetProperty will allow you
 * to specify an SSLContextRef for a stream.  If the stream has not
 * been opened, the SSLContextRef will replace any existing
 * SSLContextRef and be used in the initial stream handshake.  If the
 * stream has been opened without SSL enabled, setting this property
 * will initiate an SSL handshake over the existing socket.
 *
 * If an SSL settings dictionary was set via
 * kCFStreamPropertySSLSettings, a SSLContextRef is created internally
 * and configured as per the dictionary.  However, if an SSLContextRef
 * is set after this, its configuration will take precedence over the
 * previously configured context.
 *
 * Reconfiguring an SSLContext after the stream it is bound to has
 * opened is unsupported.
 *
 * Note that this property is currently only supported on iOS 5.0 and
 * later.
