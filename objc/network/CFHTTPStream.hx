 *  CFReadStreamCreateForHTTPRequest()
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *	Create an HTTP read stream for the response to the given request.
 *	When the stream is opened, it will begin transmitting the
 *	request. The bytes returned are the pure body bytes; the response
 *	header has been parsed off. To retrieve the response header, ask
 *	for kCFStreamPropertyHTTPResponseHeader, above, any time after
 *	the first bytes arrive on the stream (or when stream end is
 *	reported, if there are no data bytes). When an HTTP/1.1 server
 *	returns a chunked a response, the chunks will be formed into one
 *	continuous stream.
 *  
 *  Parameters:
 *	
 *	alloc:
 *	  A pointer to the CFAllocator which should be used to allocate
 *	  memory for the CF read stream and its storage for values. If
 *	  this reference is not a valid CFAllocator, the behavior is
 *	  undefined.
 *	
 *	request:
 *	  A pointer to a CFHTTPMessage created by the
 *	  CFHTTPMessageCreateRequest function.
 *  
 *  Result:
 *	A pointer to the CF read stream created, or NULL if failed. It is

 *  CFReadStreamCreateForStreamedHTTPRequest()
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *	Creates a read stream for the response to the given
 *	requestHeaders plus requestBody. Use in preference to
 *	CFReadStreamCreateForHTTPRequest() when the body of the request
 *	is larger than you wish to be resident in memory.  Note that
 *	because streams cannot be reset, read streams created this way
 *	cannot have autoredirection enabled.  If the Content-Length
 *	header is set in requestHeaders, it is assumed that the caller
 *	got the length right and that requestBody will report
 *	end-of-stream after precisely Content-Length bytes have been read
 *	from it. If the Content-Length header is not set, the chunked
 *	transfer-encoding will be added to requestHeaders, and bytes read
 *	from requestBody will be transmitted chunked. The body of
 *	requestHeaders is ignored.
