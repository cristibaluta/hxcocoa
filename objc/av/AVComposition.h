    @class			AVComposition

    @abstract		An AVComposition combines media data from multiple local file-based sources in a custom temporal arrangement,
    				in order to present or process media data from multiple sources together. All local file-based audiovisual 
    				assets are eligible to be combined, regardless of container type.
	
	@discussion		At its top-level, AVComposition is a collection of tracks, each presenting media of a specific media type,
					e.g. audio or video, according to a timeline. Each track is represented by an instance of AVCompositionTrack.

					Each track is comprised of an array of track segments, each of which present a portion of the media data
					stored in a source container, specified by URL, a track identifier, and a time mapping, as represented by
					an instance of AVCompositionTrackSegment.
					The URL specifies the source container, and the track identifier indicates the track of the source container
					to be presented.
					The time mapping specifies the temporal range of the source track that's to be presented and also specifies
					the temporal range of its presentation in the composition track. If the durations of the source and destination
					ranges of the time mapping are the same, the media data for the segment will be presented at its natural rate.
					Otherwise, the segment will be presented at a rate equal to the ratio source.duration / target.duration.
					
					The track segments of a track are available via AVCompositionTrack's trackSegment property, an array of
					AVCompositionTrackSegment. The collection of tracks with media type information for each, and each with its
					array of track segments (URL, track identifier, and time mapping), form a complete low-level representation
					of a composition.
					This representation can be written out by clients in any convenient form, and subsequently the
					composition can be reconstituted by instantiating a new AVMutableComposition with AVMutableCompositionTracks
					of the appropriate media type, each with its trackSegment property set according to the stored array of
					URL, track identifier, and time mapping.
					
					A higher-level interface for constructing compositions is also presented by AVMutableComposition
					and AVMutableCompositionTrack, offering insertion, removal, and scaling operations without direct
					manipulation of the trackSegment arrays of composition tracks. This interface makes use of higher-level
					constructs such as AVAsset and AVAssetTrack, allowing the client to make use of the same references to
					candidate sources that it would have created in order to inspect or preview them prior to inclusion
					in a composition.

					Implementation note: to make an immutable snapshot of a mutable composition for playback or inspection --
					
					// myMutableComposition is a mutable composition; the client wants to inspect and play it in its current state
					AVComposition *immutableSnapshotOfMyComposition = [myMutableComposition copy];
				
					// inspect and play at will, e.g.
					AVPlayerItem *playerItemForSnapshottedComposition = [[AVPlayerItem alloc] initWithAsset:immutableSnapshotOfMyComposition];
