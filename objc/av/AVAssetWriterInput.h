	Clients that need to write multiple concurrent tracks of media data should use one AVAssetWriterInput instance per track. In order to write multiple concurrent tracks with ideal interleaving of media data, clients should observe the value returned by the readyForMoreMediaData property of each AVAssetWriterInput instance.
	
	AVAssetWriterInput also supports writing per-track metadata collections to the output file.

 @method assetWriterInputWithMediaType:outputSettings:
 @abstract
	Creates a new input of the specified media type to receive sample buffers for writing to the output file.

 @param mediaType
	The media type of samples that will be accepted by the input. Media types are defined in AVMediaFormat.h.
 @param outputSettings
	The settings used for encoding the media appended to the output.  See AVAudioSettings.h for AVMediaTypeAudio or AVVideoSettings.h for AVMediaTypeVideo and for more information on how to construct an output settings dictionary.
 @result
	An instance of AVAssetWriterInput.

 @discussion
	Each new input accepts data for a new track of the AVAssetWriter's output file.  Inputs are added to an asset writer using -[AVAssetWriter addInput:].
	
	Passing nil for output settings instructs the input to pass through appended samples, doing no processing before they are written to the output file.  This is useful if, for example, you are appending buffers that are already in a desirable compressed format.  However, passthrough is currently supported only when writing to QuickTime Movie files (i.e. the AVAssetWriter was initialized with AVFileTypeQuickTimeMovie).  For other file types, non-nil output settings must be specified.
 
	For AVMediaTypeAudio, AVEncoderAudioQualityKey and AVSampleRateConverterAudioQualityKey are not currently supported in the outputSettings dictionary.  When using this method to construct a new instance, an audio settings dictionary must be fully specified, meaning that it must contain AVFormatIDKey, AVSampleRateKey, and AVNumberOfChannelsKey.  If no other channel layout information is available, a value of 1 for AVNumberOfChannelsKey will result in mono output and a value of 2 will result in stereo output.  If AVNumberOfChannelsKey specifies a channel count greater than 2, the dictionary must also specify a value for AVChannelLayoutKey.  For kAudioFormatLinearPCM, all relevant AVLinearPCM*Key keys must be included, and for kAudioFormatAppleLossless, AVEncoderBitDepthHintKey keys must be included.  See +assetWriterInputWithMediaType:outputSettings:sourceFormatHint: for a way to avoid having to specify a value for each of those keys.
 
	For AVMediaTypeVideo, any output settings dictionary must request a compressed video format.  This means that the value passed in for outputSettings must follow the rules for compressed video output, as laid out in AVVideoSettings.h.  When using this method to construct a new instance, a video settings dictionary must be fully specified, meaning that it must contain AVVideoCodecKey, AVVideoWidthKey, and AVVideoHeightKey.

 	public var  readyForMoreMediaData
 @abstract
	Indicates the readiness of the input to accept more media data.
 
 @discussion
    When there are multiple inputs, AVAssetWriter tries to write media data in an ideal interleaving pattern for efficiency in storage and playback. Each of its inputs signals its readiness to receive media data for writing according to that pattern via the value of readyForMoreMediaData. If readyForMoreMediaData is YES, an input can accept additional media data while maintaining appropriate interleaving. If media data is appended to an input after readyForMoreMediaData becomes NO, AVAssetWriter may need to write media data to its output without regard for ideal interleaving.
 
    Generally, clients should append media data to an input only while its readyForMoreMediaData property is YES.
 
    Clients writing media data from a non-real-time source, such as an instance of AVAssetReader, should hold off on generating or obtaining more media data to append to an input when the value of readyForMoreMediaData is NO. To help with control of the supply of non-real-time media data, such clients can use -requestMediaDataWhenReadyOnQueue:usingBlock in order to specify a block that the input should invoke whenever it's ready for input to be appended.

    Clients writing media data from a real-time source, such as an instance of AVCaptureOutput, should set the input's expectsMediaDataInRealTime property to YES to ensure that the value of readyForMoreMediaData is calculated appropriately. When expectsMediaDataInRealTime is YES, readyForMoreMediaData will become NO only when the input cannot process media samples as quickly as they are being provided by the client. If readyForMoreMediaData becomes NO for a real-time source, the client may need to drop samples or consider reducing the data rate of appended samples.
 
    The value of readyForMoreMediaData will often change from NO to YES asynchronously, as previously supplied media data is processed and written to the output.  It is possible for all of an AVAssetWriter's AVAssetWriterInputs temporarily to return NO for readyForMoreMediaData.

 @method requestMediaDataWhenReadyOnQueue:usingBlock:
 @abstract
	Instructs the receiver to invoke a client-supplied block repeatedly, at its convenience, in order to gather media data for writing to the output file.

 @param queue
	The queue on which the block should be invoked.
 @param block
	The block the input should invoke to obtain media data.

 @discussion
	The block should append media data to the input either until the input's readyForMoreMediaData property becomes NO or until there is no more media data to supply (at which point it may choose to mark the input as finished via -markAsFinished). The block should then exit. After the block exits, if the input has not been marked as finished, once the input has processed the media data it has received and becomes ready for more media data again, it will invoke the block again in order to obtain more.
 
    A typical use of this method, with a block that supplies media data to an input while respecting the input's readyForMoreMediaData property, might look like this:

    [myAVAssetWriterInput requestMediaDataWhenReadyOnQueue:myInputSerialQueue usingBlock:^{
        while ([myAVAssetWriterInput isReadyForMoreMediaData])
        {
            CMSampleBufferRef nextSampleBuffer = [self copyNextSampleBufferToWrite];
            if (nextSampleBuffer)
            {
                [myAVAssetWriterInput appendSampleBuffer:nextSampleBuffer];
                CFRelease(nextSampleBuffer);
            }
            else
            {
                [myAVAssetWriterInput markAsFinished];
                break;
            }
        }
    }];
 
	This method is not recommended for use with a push-style buffer source, such as AVCaptureAudioDataOutput or AVCaptureVideoDataOutput, because such a combination will likely require intermediate queueing of buffers.  Instead, this method is better suited to a pull-style buffer source such as AVAssetReaderOutput, as illustrated in the above example.
 
	When using a push-style buffer source, it is generally better to immediately append each buffer to the AVAssetWriterInput, directly via -[AVAssetWriter appendSampleBuffer:], as it is received.  Using this strategy, it is often possible to avoid  having to queue up buffers in between the buffer source and the AVAssetWriterInput.  Note that many of these push-style buffer sources also produce buffers in real-time, in which case the client should set expectsMediaDataInRealTime to YES.
 
	Before calling this method, you must ensure that the receiver is attached to an AVAssetWriter via a prior call to -addInput: and that -startWriting has been called on the asset writer.

 @method appendSampleBuffer:
 @abstract
	Appends samples to the receiver.

 @param sampleBuffer
	The CMSampleBuffer to be appended.
 @result
	A BOOL value indicating success of appending the sample buffer. If a result of NO is returned, clients can check the value of AVAssetWriter.status to determine whether the writing operation completed, failed, or was cancelled.  If the status is AVAssetWriterStatusFailed, AVAsset.error will contain an instance of NSError that describes the failure.
 
 @discussion
	The timing information in the sample buffer, considered relative to the time passed to -[AVAssetWriter startSessionAtSourceTime:], will be used to determine the timing of those samples in the output file.
 
	The receiver will retain the CMSampleBuffer until it is done with it, and then release it.  Do not modify a CMSampleBuffer or its contents after you have passed it to this method.
 
	If the sample buffer contains audio data and the AVAssetWriterInput was intialized with an outputSettings dictionary then the format must be linear PCM. If the outputSettings dictionary was nil then audio data can be provided in a compressed format, and it will be passed through to the output without any re-compression. Note that advanced formats like AAC will have encoder delay present in their bitstreams. This data is inserted by the encoder and is necessary for proper decoding, but it is not meant to be played back. Clients who provide compressed audio bitstreams must use kCMSampleBufferAttachmentKey_TrimDurationAtStart to mark the encoder delay (generally restricted to the first sample buffer). Packetization can cause there to be extra audio frames in the last packet which are not meant to be played back. These remainder frames should be marked with kCMSampleBufferAttachmentKey_TrimDurationAtEnd. CMSampleBuffers obtained from AVAssetReader will already have the necessary trim attachments. Please see http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/technotes/tn2009/tn2258.html for more information about encoder delay. When attaching trims make sure that the output PTS of the sample buffer is what you expect. For example if you called -[AVAssetWriter startSessionAtSourceTime:kCMTimeZero] and you want your audio to start at time zero in the output file then make sure that the output PTS of the first non-fully trimmed audio sample buffer is kCMTimeZero.
	
	If the sample buffer contains a CVPixelBuffer then the choice of pixel format will affect the performance and quality of the encode. Below are some recommendations.

	iOS:
	For optimal performance the format of the pixel buffer should match one of the native formats supported by the selected video encoder. The H.264 encoder natively supports kCVPixelFormatType_420YpCbCr8BiPlanarVideoRange and kCVPixelFormatType_420YpCbCr8BiPlanarFullRange, which should be used with video and full range input respectively. The JPEG encoder natively supports kCVPixelFormatType_422YpCbCr8FullRange. Pixel buffers not in a natively supported format will be converted internally prior to encoding when possible. Pixel format conversions within the same range (video or full) are generally faster than conversions between different ranges.
 
	Mac OS X:
	kCVPixelFormatType_422YpCbCr8 is the preferred pixel format for video and is generally the most performant when encoding. If you need to work in the RGB domain then kCVPixelFormatType_32ARGB is recommended. Pixel buffers not in a natively supported format will be converted internally prior to encoding when possible.
 
	The ProRes encoders can preserve high bit depth sources, supporting up to 12bits/ch. ProRes 4444 can contain a mathematically lossless alpha channel and it doesn't do any chroma subsampling. This makes ProRes 4444 ideal for quality critical applications. If you are working with 8bit sources ProRes is also a good format to use due to its high image quality. Use either of the recommended pixel formats above. Note that RGB pixel formats by definition have 4:4:4 chroma sampling.
 
 	If you are working with high bit depth sources the following yuv pixel formats are recommended when encoding to ProRes: kCVPixelFormatType_4444AYpCbCr16, kCVPixelFormatType_422YpCbCr16, and kCVPixelFormatType_422YpCbCr10. When working in the RGB domain kCVPixelFormatType_64ARGB is recommended. Scaling and color matching are not currently supported when using AVAssetWriter with any of these high bit depth pixel formats. Please make sure that your track's output settings dictionary specifies the same width and height as the buffers you will be appending. Do not include AVVideoScalingModeKey or AVVideoColorPropertiesKey.

	Before calling this method, you must ensure that the receiver is attached to an AVAssetWriter via a prior call to -addInput: and that -startWriting has been called on the asset writer.

If you need to work in the RGB domain then kCVPixelFormatType_32ARGB is recommended. Pixel buffers not in a natively supported format will be converted internally prior to encoding when possible.
 
	The ProRes encoders can preserve high bit depth sources, supporting up to 12bits/ch. ProRes 4444 can contain a mathematically lossless alpha channel and it doesn't do any chroma subsampling. This makes ProRes 4444 ideal for quality critical applications. If you are working with 8bit sources ProRes is also a good format to use due to its high image quality. Use either of the recommended pixel formats above. Note that RGB pixel formats by definition have 4:4:4 chroma sampling.
 
 	If you are working with high bit depth sources the following yuv pixel formats are recommended when encoding to ProRes: kCVPixelFormatType_4444AYpCbCr16, kCVPixelFormatType_422YpCbCr16, and kCVPixelFormatType_422YpCbCr10. When working in the RGB domain kCVPixelFormatType_64ARGB is recommended. Scaling and color matching are not currently supported when using AVAssetWriter with any of these high bit depth pixel formats. Please make sure that your track's output settings dictionary specifies the same width and height as the buffers you will be appending. Do not include AVVideoScalingModeKey or AVVideoColorPropertiesKey.
 
	Before calling this method, you must ensure that the receiver is attached to an AVAssetWriter via a prior call to -addInput: and that -startWriting has been called on the asset writer.
