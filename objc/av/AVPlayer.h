	@class			AVPlayer
 
	@abstract
      AVPlayer offers a playback interface for single-item playback that's sufficient for
      the implementation of playback controllers and playback user interfaces.
 
	@discussion
      AVPlayer works equally well with local and remote media files, providing clients with appropriate
      information about readiness to play or about the need to await additional data before continuing.

      Visual content of items played by an instance of AVPlayer can be displayed in a CoreAnimation layer
      of class AVPlayerLayer.

	  To allow clients to add and remove their objects as key-value observers safely, AVPlayer serializes notifications of
	  changes that occur dynamically during playback on a dispatch queue. By default, this queue is the main queue. See dispatch_get_main_queue().
	  
	  To ensure safe access to AVPlayer's nonatomic properties while dynamic changes in playback state may be reported, clients must
	  serialize their access with the receiver's notification queue. In the common case, such serialization is naturally achieved
	  by invoking AVPlayer's various methods on the main thread or queue.
