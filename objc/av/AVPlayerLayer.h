    @class			AVPlayerLayer

    @abstract		AVPlayerLayer is a subclass of CALayer to which an AVPlayer can direct its visual output.

	@discussion		To create an AVPlayerLayer instance:
					
					AVPlayer *player = ...;
					// ... set up an AVPlayer
					
					CALayer *superlayer = ...;
					AVPlayerLayer *playerLayer = [AVPlayerLayer playerLayerWithPlayer:player];
 
					// ... set up the AVPlayerLayer's geometry. For example: set the AVPlayerLayer frame according to the presentationSize of the AVPlayer's currentItem.
					
					[superlayer addSublayer:playerLayer];
					
					AVPlayerLayer provides a property 'videoGravity' that defines how the video content is displayed within the AVPlayerLayer property 'bounds' rect. 
					The value for the @"contents" key of an AVPlayerLayer is opaque and effectively read-only.

					Note that during playback AVPlayer may compensate for temporal drift between its visual output
					and its audible output to one or more independently-clocked audio output devices by adjusting the timing of its
					associated AVPlayerLayers. The effects of these adjustments are usually very minute; however, clients that
					wish to remain entirely unaffected by such adjustments may wish to place other layers for which timing is
					important into indepedently timed subtrees of their layer trees.
