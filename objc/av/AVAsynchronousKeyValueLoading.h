  @method		statusOfValueForKey:
  @abstract		Reports whether the value for a key is immediately available without blocking.
  @param		key
    An instance of NSString containing the specified key.
  @param		outError
    If the status of the value for the key is AVKeyValueStatusFailed, *outError is set to a non-nil NSError that describes the failure that occurred.
  @result		The value's current loading status.
  @discussion
    Clients can use -statusOfValueForKey: to determine the availability of the value of any key of interest. However, this method alone does not prompt the receiver to load the value of a key that's not yet available. To request values for keys that may not already be loaded, without blocking, use -loadValuesAsynchronouslyForKeys:completionHandler:, await invocation of the completion handler, and test the availability of each key via -statusOfValueForKey: before invoking its getter.
 
    Even if access to values of some keys may be readily available, as can occur with receivers initialized with URLs for resources on local volumes, extensive I/O or parsing may be needed for these same receivers to provide values for other keys. A duration for a local MP3 file, for example, may be expensive to obtain, even if the values for other AVAsset properties may be trivial to obtain.

    Blocking that may occur when calling the getter for any key should therefore be avoided in the general case by loading values for all keys of interest via -loadValuesAsynchronouslyForKeys:completionHandler: and testing the availability of the requested values before fetching them by calling getters.
      
    The sole exception to this general rule is in usage on Mac OS X on the desktop, where it may be acceptable to block in cases in which the client is preparing objects for use on background threads or in operation queues. On iOS, values should always be loaded asynchronously prior to calling getters for the values, in any usage scenario.
