 @class AVCaptureInput
 @abstract
    AVCaptureInput is an abstract class that provides an interface for connecting capture input sources to an
    AVCaptureSession.

 @discussion
    Concrete instances of AVCaptureInput representing input sources such as cameras can be added to instances of
    AVCaptureSession using the -[AVCaptureSession addInput:] method. An AVCaptureInput vends one or more streams of
    media data. For example, input devices can provide both audio and video data. Each media stream provided by an input
    is represented by an AVCaptureInputPort object. Within a capture session, connections are made between
    AVCaptureInput instances and AVCaptureOutput instances via AVCaptureConnection objects that define the mapping
    between a set of AVCaptureInputPort objects and a single AVCaptureOutput.

 @discussion
    Instances of AVCaptureInputPort cannot be created directly. An AVCaptureInput exposes its input ports via its ports
    property. Input ports provide information about the format of their media data via the mediaType and
    formatDescription properties, and allow clients to control the flow of data via the enabled property. Input ports
    are used by an AVCaptureConnection to define the mapping between inputs and outputs in an AVCaptureSession.
