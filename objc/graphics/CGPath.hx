   Note that using values very near 2π can be problematic. For example,
   setting `startAngle' to 0, `endAngle' to 2π, and `clockwise' to true will
   draw nothing. (It's easy to see this by considering, instead of 0 and 2π,
   the values ε and 2π - ε, where ε is very small.) Due to round-off error,
   however, it's possible that passing the value `2 * M_PI' to approximate
   2π will numerically equal to 2π + δ, for some small δ; this will cause a
   full circle to be drawn.

   If you want a full circle to be drawn clockwise, you should set
   `startAngle' to 2π, `endAngle' to 0, and `clockwise' to true. This avoids
   the instability problems discussed above. */
