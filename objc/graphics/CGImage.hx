   If `mask' is an image mask, then it indicates which parts of the context
   are to be painted with the image when drawn in a context, and which are
   to be masked out (left unchanged). The source samples of the image mask
   determine which areas are painted, acting as an "inverse alpha": if the
   value of a source sample in the image mask is S, then the corresponding
   region in `image' is blended with the destination using an alpha of
   (1-S). (For example, if S is 1, then the region is not painted, while if
   S is 0, the region is fully painted.)

   If `mask' is an image, then it serves as alpha mask for blending the
   image onto the destination. The source samples of `mask' determine which
   areas are painted: if the value of the source sample in mask is S, then
   the corresponding region in image is blended with the destination with an
   alpha of S. (For example, if S is 0, then the region is not painted,
   while if S is 1, the region is fully painted.)

   The parameter `image' may not be an image mask and may not have an image
   mask or masking color associated with it.
  
   If `mask' is an image, then it must be in the DeviceGray color space, may
   not have alpha, and may not itself be masked by an image mask or a

   {c[1], ... c[N]} where min[i] <= c[i] <= max[i] for 1 <= i <= N is masked
   out (that is, not painted).

   Each value in `components' must be a valid image sample value: if `image'
   has integral pixel components, then each value of must be in the range
   [0..2**bitsPerComponent - 1] (where `bitsPerComponent' is the number of
