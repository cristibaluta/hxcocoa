/* NSOrthography is a class used to describe the linguistic content of a piece of text, especially for the purposes of spelling and grammar checking.  It describes (a) which scripts the text contains, (b) a dominant language and possibly other languages for each of these scripts, and (c) a dominant script and language for the text as a whole.  Scripts are uniformly described by standard four-letter tags (Latn, Grek, Cyrl, etc.) with the supertags Jpan and Kore typically used for Japanese and Korean text, Hans and Hant for Chinese text; the tag Zyyy is used if a specific script cannot be identified.  Languages are uniformly described by BCP-47 tags, preferably in canonical form; the tag und is used if a specific language cannot be determined. */
