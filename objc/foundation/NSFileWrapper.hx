For performance NSFileWrapper may or may not immediately read the contents of some file packages immediately even when this option is chosen. For example, the contents of bundles (not all file packages are bundles) are immutable to the user so on Mac OS X NSFileWrapper may read the children of such a directory lazily. You can use this option to take a reasonable snapshot of a file or folder for writing later. For example, a Mac OS X application like TextEdit can use this option when creating new file wrappers to represent attachments that the user creates by copying and pasting or dragging and dropping from the Finder to a TextEdit document. You wouldn't use this option when reading a document file package because that would cause unnecessarily bad perfomance. For example, an application wouldn't use this option when creating file wrappers to represent attachments as it's opening a document stored in a file package.

This is useful if you want to make sure your application doesn't hold files open (mapped files are open files) and therefore prevent the user from ejecting DVDs, unmounting disk partitions, or unmounting disk images.
